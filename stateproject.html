<p>  Florida is one of the oldest states in the United States so it has a long territorial history, in these next four paragraphs I will give you a brief summary of Florida's territorial history.   Florida was first discovered by Juan Ponce de Leon who claimed it as land for Spain in 1513 |1| , He also started St. Augustine the oldest European settlement in the continental US in 1565. |2| Florida remained controlled by Spain until close to the end of the American Revolution,After which Great Britain would take over Florida (in 1783) |2| and then give it back to Spain (in 1785) |2|, Florida was given back to the colonists soon after that (in 1795). |2|   Although Florida was recognized as belonging to the colonist by the other countries like Great Britain and France, Florida was still controlled mostly by Indians and for a short time it stayed that way, until it was invaded by the colonists (Led by George Mathews) in 1812 although Mathew's forces where outnumbered and so they retreated. |2|  Later on Congress and President James Monroe decided to make Florida (and other states in the US) official states of the United States so they signed the Indian Removal Act. This act required all native Americans to move west of the Mississippi River. |2| After Many long wars the law was forced upon the native Americans and Florida was later admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845. |3| </p>
