<p>DISSECTION EXPERIMENT 5.3 The Sea Star BE CAREFUL! Dissecting tools are sharp. You should be cutting the specimen &mdash; not yourself! Introduction: In this lab, you will become more familiar with the anatomy of the sea star. Even though the supplies list calls for a microscope, you can do the dissection without one. The microscope is used only to determine the sex of your sea star. _ Procedure: 1. Examine your specimen. Use Figure 5.14 and the photos on the next page as guides to help you locate the madreporite (a lightly colored, circular spot on the aboral side), the central disc (the main &quot;body&quot; of the sea star), and the five arms. NOTE: Your sea star should have five arms. Some specimens may have fewer arms due to accidents related to the handling of the specimen. ambulacral groove 2. Turn the sea star upside-down and use Figure 5.14 and the pictures above as guides to help you locate the central mouth, ambulacral grooves, and tube feet. Make a sketch of what you see, labeling the various parts of your specimen. 3. Turn the sea star back over so that its mouth is facing down. Carefully take the point of your scalpel and cut into the skin of an arm, about 1 inch from its tip. Slowly cut along the length of the arm and around the central disc as shown by the red line in the drawing below. This will expose the internal organs. NOTE: It may be a bit difficult to cut, but try not to cut too deeply. This will require a little effort. 4. Once you remove the hard outer layer, you should notice that much of the space in the arm is taken up by two branched digestive glands, as pointed out in the drawing above. 5. Gently lift the digestive glands out of the arm and look at them closely with the magnifying glass. Note the highly lobed, branched structure. 6. Follow the duct at the base of the digestive glands to the central stomach. The stomach has a lower and an upper lobe (in smaller specimens, this may be difficult to differentiate). The lower portion, called the cardiac stomach, is the portion the sea star everts through its mouth for feeding. 7. Remove the digestive glands by cutting the duct that connects them to the stomach. You should see a yellowish, soft, bead-like material in the arms. These are the gonads. Male and female gonads look the same in sea stars. To determine the sex of your sea star you can examine them under the microscope later. Save a piece of gonad for this procedure. 8. Remove the reproductive organs and stomach in order to observe the water vascular system. 9. You most likely had to cut the madreporite when you removed the skin of the sea star, but you will probably be able to see a ridged canal along the arm. This is the back side of the ambulacral groove. On each side of the ridge, look for several, small, clear, bulb-like structures. These are the ampullae (am pyoo' lay) that connect to the tube feet on the underside of the arm. The radial canal, which feeds the ampullae with water, is located in the ridge and travels to the center of the sea star where it joins with the ring-like canal to the madreporite. 10. Remove the rest of the material from the center of the sea star. You should have exposed five pairs of tiny, white teeth surrounding the mouth. Make a sketch of what you see. 11. Clean everything up, saving the portion of the gonads for the microscope. 12. Set up the microscope. 13. Put a very small portion of gonad on a slide, add a drop of water, and mix the water with the piece of gonad. 14. Place a coverslip on top. 15. Observe the slide on all three magnifications. The testes of the male have tiny, flagellated sperm, while the ovaries of the female have large, round eggs. Make note of which sex your specimen is in your lab notebook. 16. Clean the slide and coverslip. Put the microscope away.</p>

<p>Conclusion In this lab we learned about the many different parts of the star fishes internal anatomy and how these parts look and how they help the animal survive in its habitat.</p>

<p> EXPERIMENT 6.1 Types of Fish Scales Supplies: &bull; Microscope &bull; Lens paper &bull; Prepared slide: Dogfish placoid scales &bull; Prepared slide: Cycloid scale &bull; Prepared slide: Ctenoid scale Object: To study the differences between various fish scale types</p>

<p>Procedure: 1. Observe the dogfish placoid scale at both 40x and 100x. This is an example of the denticles of cartilaginous fishes. Draw a sample scale, noting any important observations. 2. Observe the cycloid scale at 40x magnification. You will have to move the slide around to see all of it. Notice how different it is from the placoid scale. One thing you have to think about is the size. For the placoid scale, you needed 100x magnification to see it well. For this scale, 40x magnification is almost too much, because you have to move the slide around to see the whole scale. Thus, the cycloid scale is much bigger than the placoid scale. 3. Make a sketch of what you see, noting the smoothness and ribbed texture. 4. Cycloid scales often have growth rings that show how much they have grown each year. They are sometimes used to judge the age of a fish. See if there are growth rings on your cycloid scale. 5. Observe the ctenoid scale at 40x magnification. Note the difference between this kind of scale and the other two scales you have already seen. 6. Make a sketch of what you see. 7. Ctene comes from the Greek meaning &quot;teeth.&quot; Why do you think this word was chosen for this type of scale? 8. Ctenoid scales also can have growth rings. See if you can find any on the one you have. 9. Clean everything up and put everything away.</p>

<p>Conclusion In this experiment we observed the different types of scales (dogfish, Cycloid, and Ctenoid Scales and how they look under a microscope. This helps us to understand how these types of fish are different.</p>

<p>Dissection Experiment 6.2 Supplies: &bull; Dissecting tools and tray &bull; Dogfish shark specimen &bull; Magnifying glass &bull; Laboratory notebook Procedure: I. Examine your specimen. Identify all the external structures shown in Figure 6.3. In the dogfish shark, there are spines located anterior to the first and second dorsal fins. The spines were probably removed when the specimen was prepared, but you should be able to see their original positions. 2. Look on the inside edge of the pelvic fins for the presence of claspers. These finger-like extensions are present in male sharks only and aid in sperm transfer during mating. If claspers exist, your shark is male. If not, it is female. Note the gender of your shark. 3. Open the specimen's mouth and examine the teeth. Describe what you see in your lab notebook, making note of the many rows. 4. Now you are ready to look at the internal structures. Place your shark ventral side up on the dissecting tray. Using scissors, make a cut from the left side of the jaw down to just above the pelvic fins. When you make the cut, be sure the blunt tip of your scissors is inside the shark. 5. Make a cut from the posterior of one pectoral fin to the other. Finally, make a cut from the anterior of one pelvic fin to the other. Your cuts should look like lines in the drawing below: 6. Once you peel back the skin, you should be able to see the internal organs of your specimen. Using Figure 6.14 and the pictures below as guides, try to locate the following organs: Liver &mdash; This should be spongy, gray, and large, with two noticeable lobes. Stomach &mdash; This should be J-shaped and between the lobes of the liver. Pancreas &mdash; This is a lighter color than the stomach and should be found just posterior to the hook of the &quot;J.&quot; Spiral intestine &mdash; This has an extensive network of arteries and veins over its surface. Spleen &mdash; This is just posterior to the stomach and next to the spiral intestine. 7. Carefully remove the organs you just identified. 8. Make a vertical cut through part of the spiral intestine to observe the funnel-shaped folds. You can imagine the food moving through the &quot;spiral staircase&quot; of these folds. 9. Cut open the stomach. The remnants of the shark's last dinner may still be inside! 10. Pull back the skin from the mouth to the pectoral fins. This will expose the two-chambered heart, which should be located between the left and right gill slits. You may need to pin the flaps of skin so they stay open. 11. The shark has two kidneys on either side of the midline. 12. If you have a male shark, you should see two testes just dorsal to where the liver lobes were. They are an elongated oval shape. If you have a female shark, you should see two cream-colored ovaries there. 13. Now it is time to find the brain. Turn the specimen over and remove the skin from between the eyes to the start of the gills. 14. Using the scissors, scrape the skull material until it becomes thin. Eventually, it will be thin enough so you can remove it bit by bit with the forceps. The skull is not very thick, and this is the best way to remove it without disturbing the tissue below. 15. Once the brain is exposed, see if you can find the various parts as described below from anterior to posterior: Olfactory lobes &mdash; This is the most anterior portion of the brain and is comparatively larger than the rest of the lobes. There should be two olfactory lobes. Cerebrum &mdash; This is the narrower area just posterior to the olfactory lobes. Optic lobes &mdash; This is more swollen than the cerebrum and is posterior to the cerebrum. Cerebellum &mdash; This is an oval-shaped section on the posterior end of the brain. 16. Make a sketch of the brain, identifying its parts. 17. Clean up everything. Wash and dry your tools and tray. Put everything away.</p>

<p>Conclusion in this lab we learned about the sharks anatomy and where the different parts of the sharks anatomy are located.</p>

<p> Experiment 7.1 What Causes Bends Supplies: &bull; An unopened 2-liter bottle of clear soda (a smaller bottle will also work, but not as well) &bull; Lab notebook</p>

<p>Object: To learn about what could happen in a person's bloodstream if he experiences excessive pressure changes.</p>

<p>Procedure: 1. Observe the liquid in the bottle. Make note of anything you see, particularly noting its clarity. 2. Open the bottle. Make note of what you feel with your hand and hear. 3. Now look at the liquid in the bottle. Make note of what you see. 4. Put everything away.</p>

<p>Conclusion in this experiment we listened to how the oxygen is released from a bottle this is similar to how oxygen is released from bends thus giving us a better understanding of how bends work.</p>

<p>Experiment 8.1 Exploring Carbon Fixation Supplies: &bull; 2 marshmallows &bull; A small metal skewer or fork &bull; A clear glass mason jar &bull; A match (plus a helper who can hold it for you) &bull; A sink</p>

<p> Introduction: In this experiment, you will learn a little about the carbon fixed in sugars.</p>

<p>Procedure: 1. Take one marshmallow and look at it. Go ahead and eat it. 2. Take the other marshmallow and put it on the skewer or fork. 3. Hold the marshmallow over the sink and have your helper light it with the match. 4. Allow it to burn a few seconds, and then blow out the flame. 5. Observe the burned part. Make a note of what you see. 6. Again, over a sink, re-light the marshmallow, and holding the jar upside down, carefully place the jar over the marshmallow, trying not to touch the sides with the burning marshmallow. (NOTE: Hold the jar near its mouth while the marshmallow is up inside of it. The jar's bottom will be very hot!) 7. Notice what is happening to the inside of the jar. Remove the marshmallow and blow it out. 8. Make a note of what you see, and clean everything up.</p>

<p>Conclusion in this experiment we learned about how carbon fixation affected the marshmallow because they are mostly air and sugar. It caused the jar to fog up and the marshmallow to burn because of the water found in the sugar molecules.</p>

<p>Experiment 9.1 Exploring Intertidal Sediments Supplies: &bull; A large, clear glass jar &bull; At least 1 cup each of sand, clay, and gravel (These can be found at most garden supply stores. Please note that the clay is not modeling clay. It is the kind of clay you use for plants.) &bull; A garden hose &bull; A large spoon Introduction: The sediment of the intertidal is determined by the amount of wave action through the area. In this experiment, you will explore what happens to sediments of different sizes when exposed to the movement of water. NOTE: This lab is best performed outside in an area where water and the sediments within it can spill out freely. Procedure: 1. Add 1 cup each of sand, clay, and gravel to the jar and add enough water to fill the jar about three fourths full. 2. Carefully stir the material in the jar until it is thoroughly mixed. 3. Set the jar on a grassy area (or other parent-approved location), and turn on the water to the garden hose so that it flows steadily but gently. In other words, it should be a little more than a trickle, not a fast, heavy stream. 4. Put the end of the hose into the jar so that the water level rises up to the top and continues to overflow out of the jar. 5. While water is spilling out, use the spoon to gently stir the sediments every few seconds so that they remain suspended in the water. 6. Do this for about five minutes. 7. Remove the hose from the jar and turn off the water. 8. Allow the jar to sit for about one hour and observe the remaining material. Make a sketch of w you see. 9. Turn the hose back on so that the water is flowing much more strongly. 10. Put the end into the jar and, once again, stir occasionally. Do this for about five minutes. 11. Turn off the hose, and put it away. 12. Allow the jar to sit again for about one hour. 13. Sketch what is remaining in the jar. 14. Clean up your mess.</p>

<p>Conclusion in this experiment we saw how the lighter sediment spilled out of the jar while the heavier sediments stayed at the bottom of the jar. This shows us how sediments are affected by intertidal waves.</p>

<p> Experiment 9.2 The Movement of Water through Sediment Supplies: &bull; A metal mesh kitchen strainer &bull; At least 1 cup each of sand and clay &bull; Two medium bowls &bull; A large spoon &bull; A measuring cup with a capacity of 1 cup &bull; A measuring cup for liquids or any container with a pouring spout &bull; Water Introduction: Water moves through different-sized sediments at different rates. You will observe water movement through two types of sediments in this experiment. Procedure: 1. Fill the measuring cup for liquids with water. 2. Place at least 1 cup of sand into a bowl and add enough water to cover it. 3. Stir the sand with the spoon until it is thoroughly wet. 4. Carefully spoon all the wet sand into the strainer. 5. Hold the sand-filled strainer over the second bowl and slowly pour water from the liquid measuring cup into the sand. Pour a little at a time and observe the speed at which the water moves through the sand and into the bowl beneath the strainer. Continue to do this until you get a good idea of how quickly the water travels through the sand. 6. Remove .the sand from the strainer to a place acceptable to your parents. Also, clean out the bowls. 7. Rinse out the strainer and repeat steps 1 through 6 using clay instead of sand. 8. Clean up your mess.</p>

<p>Conclusion in this experiment we studied how water moves through different sediments and how those sediments affect the water.</p>
