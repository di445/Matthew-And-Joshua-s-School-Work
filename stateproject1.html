remained controlled by Spain until close to the end of the American

Florida was recognized as belonging to the colonist by the other
countries like Great Britain and France, Florida was still controlled
mostly by Indians and for a short time it stayed that way, until it
was invaded by the colonists (Led by George Mathews) in 1812 although
Mathew's forces where outnumbered and so they retreated.&nbsp;</font></font><strong><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/us/florida-state-united-states-history.html" target="_blank"><sup><font face="gotham, helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">|2|</font></font></sup></a></strong><br>&nbsp;

Officers. The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of
impeachment. The speaker of the House may appoint a committee to
investigate alleged grounds for impeachment against any officer
subject to impeachment either during or between legislative sessions;
but a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members present shall be
required to impeach any officer; and all impeachments shall be tried
by the Senate. When sitting for that purpose the senators shall be
upon oath or affirmation, and no person shall be convicted without
the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of the Senate present. The Senate
may adjourn to a fixed time for the trial of any impeachment, and may
sit for the purpose of such trial whether the House of
Representatives be in session or not, but the time fixed for such
trial shall not be more than six (6) months from the time articles of
impeachment shall be preferred by the House of Representatives. The
Chief Justice shall preside at all trials by impeachment except in
the trial of the Chief Justice, when the Governor shall preside. The
Governor, Administrative officers of the Executive Department,
Justices of the Supreme Court, and Judges of the Circuit Court shall
be liable to impeachment for any misdemeanor in office, but judgment
in such cases shall extend only to removal from office and
disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust or profit under

liable to indictment, trial and punishment according to law. &quot;</font></sup></p>
